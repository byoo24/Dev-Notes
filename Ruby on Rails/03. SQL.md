    JOIN another_table
      ON mytable.column = another_table.column

# Query order of execution

## 1. FROM and JOINs
The **FROM** clause, and subsequent **JOINs** are first executed to determine the total working set of data that is being queried. This includes subqueries in this clause, and can cause temporary tables to be created under the hood containing all the columns and rows of the tables being joined.

## 2. WHERE
Once we have the total working set of data, the first-pass **WHERE** constraints are applied to the individual rows, and rows that do not satisfy the constraint are discarded. Each of the constraints can only access columns directly from the tables requested in the **FROM** clause. Aliases in the **SELECT** part of the query are not accessible in most databases since they may include expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed.

## 3. GROUP BY
The remaining rows after the **WHERE** constraints are applied are then grouped based on common values in the column specified in the **GROUP BY** clause. As a result of the grouping, there will only be as many rows as there are unique values in that column. Implicitly, this means that you should only need to use this when you have aggregate functions in your query.

## 4. HAVING
If the query has a **GROUP BY** clause, then the constraints in the **HAVING** clause are then applied to the grouped rows, discard the grouped rows that don't satisfy the constraint. Like the **WHERE** clause, aliases are also not accessible from this step in most databases.

## 5. SELECT
Any expressions in the **SELECT** part of the query are finally computed.

## 6. DISTINCT
Of the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as **DISTINCT** will be discarded.

## 7. ORDER BY
If an order is specified by the **ORDER BY** clause, the rows are then sorted by the specified data in either ascending or descending order. Since all the expressions in the **SELECT** part of the query have been computed, you can reference aliases in this clause.

## 8. LIMIT / OFFSET
Finally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by the **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** are discarded, leaving the final set of rows to be returned from the query.

## 9. Conclusion
Not every query needs to have all the parts we listed above, but a part of why SQL is so flexible is that it allows developers and data analysts to quickly manipulate data without having to write additional code, all just by using the above clauses.

# Basic Query

```sql
-- use * to select all columns
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR ...
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```


## *Conditionals*

```sql
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR ...;
```

| Operator | Condition | SQL Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | Case sensitive exact string comparison (note the single equals) | col_name = "abc" |
| != or <> | Case sensitive exact string inquality comparison | col_name != "abcd" |
| LIKE | Case insensitive exact string comparison | col_name LIKE "ABC" |
| NOT LIKE | Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison | col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD" |
| % | Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "%AT%" (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS") |
| _ | Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "AN_" (matches "AND", but not "AN") |
| BETWEEN ... AND ... | Number is within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name BETWEEN 1.5 and 10.5 |
| NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... | Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 |
| IN (...) | Number exists in a list | col_name IN (2, 4, 6) |
| NOT IN (...) | Number does not exist in a list | col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5) |

# Multi-Table Queries (with JOIN)
* `INNER JOIN` - is a process that matches rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by the ON constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables.
* `LEFT JOIN` - simply includes rows from table A regardless of whether a matching row is found in table B.
* `RIGHT JOIN` - is the same, but reversed, keeping rows in table B regardless of whether a match is found in table A.
* `FULL JOIN` - simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table.

```sql
-- use * to select all columns
SELECT column, another_table_column, ...
FROM mytable
INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table
    ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

# NULL

you can test a column for `NULL` values in a `WHERE` clause by using either the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` constraint.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE column IS/IS NOT NULL
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
```

# Queries with Expressions
In addition to querying and referencing raw column data with SQL, you can also use expressions to write more complex logic on column values in a query. These expressions can use mathematical and string functions along with basic arithmetic to transform values when the query is executed.

```sql
SELECT title, (domestic_sales + international_sales) / 1000000 AS gross_sales_millions
FROM movies
  JOIN boxoffice
    ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id;
```

# Queries with Agregates
SQL also supports the use of aggregate expressions (or functions) that allow you to summarize information about a group of rows of data.

**HAVING** clause is used specifically with the **GROUP BY** clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set.

The **HAVING** clause constraints are written the same way as the **WHERE** clause constraints, and are applied to the grouped rows. With our examples, this might not seem like a particularly useful construct, but if you imagine data with millions of rows with different properties, being able to apply additional constraints is often necessary to quickly make sense of the data.


```sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS aggregate_description, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE constraint_expression
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
```

## *Common Aggregate Functions*
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| COUNT(*), COUNT(column) | A common function used to counts the number of rows in the group if no column name is specified. Otherwise, count the number of rows in the group with non-NULL values in the specified column. |
| MIN(column) | Finds the smallest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. |
| MAX(column) | Finds the largest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. |
| AVG(column) | Finds the average numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group. |
| SUM(column) | Finds the sum of all numerical values in the specified column for the rows in the group. |
