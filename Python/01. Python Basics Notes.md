# String Formatting

Python3:
```python
age = 24

print("My age is " + str(age) + " years")
# My age is 24 years

print("There are {0} days in {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} and {7}".format(31, "January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"))
# There are 31 days in January, March, May, July, August, October and December

for i in range(1, 12):
    print("No. {0:2} squared is {1:<4} and cubed is {2:4}".format(i, i**2, i**3))

print("Pi is approximately {0:12.50f}".format(22/7))
```

Python2:
```python
# Deprecated in Python3
print("My age is %d %s, %d %s" % (age, "years", 6, "months"))

print("Pi is approximately %12.50f" % (22/7))
```
